The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down periods of work into 25-minute intervals called "pomodori" (from the Italian word pomodoro for "tomato"), separated by short breaks. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair progra1mming contexts. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.
